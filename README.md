# <Prework Study Guid Webpage>

## Description

The motivation behind this project stemmed from being able to follow instructions and figure out if I was cut out for doing some coding. This project was built to be able to become familiar with coding in general such as the three languages I learned (HTML, CSS, and Javascript) and to understand their purposes and processes and then to be able to bring it all together. The problem that it solves is to be able to build something for myself and other to view and use. I learned that I am able to code and that I can understand what everything means with a lot of diligence and practice.
